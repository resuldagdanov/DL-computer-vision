Solutions for Assignments of EECS 498-007/598-005 Deep Learning for Computer Vision (Fall 2020) course from the University of Michigan

```sh
conda create -n cv python=3.7

conda activate cv
```

Install PyTorch from this [link](https://pytorch.org/).
```python
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

NOTE: please follow readme for each assignement under folders, thanks ;)

## Assignments
The problem assignments are taken from the lecture of Justin Johnson at University of Michigan [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/).

In addition to coding, the report is preparaed about the given homework. In the report, the following details are included:
- What was the main problem/task/tool you implemented? Give brief theoretical information about it (using visuals and formulas/equations is encouraged).
- How did you fulfill the given steps? For the main functions/classes, explain your implementation in general (focus on elementary components).
- How did it perform? Were you satisfied with your results? Write down your observations and maybe criticize yourself. In the .ipynp files, you are given excellent visualization tools that are already prepared and ready for use. Please use their outputs and make comments on them.
- Recording your previous results (e.g. hyperparameter tuning results, which will be more meaningful for the later assignments) and commenting on them are encouraged.
