## Assignment 1
The link for the assignment #1 is [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/assignment1.html).

### K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
The notebook knn.ipynb will walk through implementing a kNN classifier. The implementation will go to knn.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

```bash
jupyter notebook knn.ipynb
```

### The Goals of The Assignment
* Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
* Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
* Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
* Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
* Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
* Learn how to test your implementation on Autograder

### The Reports
Please check the following folder for the reports:
