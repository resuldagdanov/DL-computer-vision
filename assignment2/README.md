## Assignment 2
The link for the assignment #2 is [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/assignment2.html).

### Linear Classifier
The notebook linear_classifier.ipynb will walk through implementing a Linear classifier. The implementation will go to linear_classifier.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

1. For SVM and Softmax linear classifier:
```bash
jupyter notebook linear_classifier.ipynb
```

### Two Layer Neural Network
The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk through implementing a Linear classifier. The implementation will go to two_layer_net.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

2. For two layer neural network classifier:
```bash
jupyter notebook two_layer_net.ipynb
```

### The Goals of The Assignment
* Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
* Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
* Implement and apply a Two-layer Neural Network classifier
* Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
* Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking
