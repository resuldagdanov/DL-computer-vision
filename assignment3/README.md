## Assignment 3
The link for the assignment #3 is [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/assignment3.html).

### Linear Classifier
The notebook fully_connected_networks.ipynb will walk through implementing a Linear classifier. The implementation will go to fully_connected_networks.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

1. For Fully-Connected Neural Network:
```bash
jupyter notebook fully_connected_networks.ipynb
```

### The Goals of The Assignment
* Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
* Understand and be able to implement modular backpropagation
* Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
* Implement Batch Normalization for training deep networks
* Implement Dropout to regularize networks

### The Reports
