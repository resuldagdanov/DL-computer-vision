## Assignment 3
The link for the assignment #3 is [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/assignment3.html).

### Fully-Connected Neural Network Classifier
The notebook fully_connected_networks.ipynb will walk through implementing a fully-connected neural network classifier. The implementation will go to fully_connected_networks.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

1. For Fully-Connected Neural Network:
```bash
jupyter notebook fully_connected_networks.ipynb
```

### Convolutional Neural Network Classifier
The notebook convolutional_networks.ipynb will walk through implementing a convolutional neural network classifier. The implementation will go to convolutional_networks.py.

Please run the following jupyter notebook to evaluate the written functions:

2. For two layer neural network classifier:
```bash
jupyter notebook convolutional_networks.ipynb
```
